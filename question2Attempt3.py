# Write a function that
# takes two lists as input and produces one list as output.
# The function should have the signature `def apply_port_exclusions(include_ports, exclude_ports)`.
# The function should expect that the input lists will be a list of low-high pairs which are lists of length two.
# The function should return a minimized and
# ordered list of include port ranges that result after processing the exclude port ranges.
# Include whatever tests and comments you normally provide for completed code.
# Helper Function to try to remove duplicate excludes
